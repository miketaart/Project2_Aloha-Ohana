## Aloha 'Ohana - Second Project Ironhack bootcamp
For my second project I developed an app together with another student which lets you create, read, update and delete city tours.
For this project the requirement was to demonstrate everything you have learned about backend coding. 
Technologies used: NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Handlebars (front end view)
Footnote: I don't prefer working like this but due to circumstances on my partner's side, we decided to divide the work and each work on either the front end or the back end. 
My role was to develop the backend and create the wireframes for the front end.
